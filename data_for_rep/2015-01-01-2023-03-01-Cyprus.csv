The Turkish warships continued to prevent the Italian rig from approaching for 2 weeks, citing naval exercises in the area. The Turkish government claimed that a large part of Cyprus's EEZ is part of its continental shelf and warned Nicosia not to take unilateral actions in the area. On 13 February, the Italian government sent a frigate of the Italian Navy, which was already participating in NATO's Sea Guardian maritime operation, to approach the EEZ of Cyprus. Nicosia issued a Navtex for an exercise on 14 February with live ammunition.
